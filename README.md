# Battle Castle

Battle Castle is a
[Java based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
multiplayer game that can be played over a
[LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network). The game allows users
to take on the roles of different archers in a battle to the death. Since the
project is built off a custom physics engine, the design of the game focuses on
player movement in order to showcase the clean and quick
[collision detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_detection) and
[impulse resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_response).

#### About
This project was an undertaking during self study in high school. The game is
mostly a proof of concept for a network game, practice using the [json file
format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), and a way to become more familiar
with simple graphical menu design in java.

## The Gameplay
Movement in the game uses keyboard input, while the shooting of arrows relies on
the mouse. This makes for simple and intuitive play. Special power-ups make
arrows bounce, give the player more jumps or turns the floor into lava. The
variety drives the gameplay giving a unique experience every time.
